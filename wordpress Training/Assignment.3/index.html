                    </h4> <br>

                    <p class="text-success" style="color: whitesmoke;">
                        <b>Big Bang</b>
                        “Then He rose over towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: ‘Come
                        both
                        of you willingly or unwillingly.’ They both said: ‘We come willingly.’” (41:11)<br>

                        “Are, then, they who are bent on denying the truth not aware that the heavens and the earth were
                        [once] one single entity, which We then parted asunder? — and We made out of water every living
                        thing? Will they not, then, believe?” (21:30)

                        The Big Bang is the most popular cosmological theory about the early development of the
                        universe.
                        The model states that the universe was in a hot and dense state that expanded rapidly. Then it
                        began
                        to cool and formed the state that we see today.

                        One verse in the Qur’an states that there was “smoke” before the heavens and the earth were
                        created,
                        and scientists believe that the universe was initially in a gaseous state, which led to the
                        formation of stars and galaxies.

                        Another verse states, “the heavens and the earth were one single entity, which We then parted
                        asunder”, which could give evidence to the Big Bang theory.<br>
                        <b>Age of Universe</b>
                        “And [who knows that] We have indeed created the heavens and the earth and all that is between
                        them
                        in six aeons, and [that] no weariness could ever touch Us.” (50:38)

                        “Say: ‘Would you indeed deny Him who has created the earth in two aeons? And do you claim that
                        there
                        is any power that could rival Him, the Sustainer of all the worlds?’” (41:9)

                        One verse in the Qur’an states that God created the universe in six aeons, and another states
                        that
                        the Earth was created in two aeons, which means that the age of the Earth is a third of the age
                        of
                        the universe. <br>

                        <b> Planets, stars & celestial bodies</b>
                        “But nay! I call to witness the revolving stars, the planets that run their course and set.”
                        (81:15–16)

                        <b>The Moon—Phases & Lunar Year</b>
                        “And the moon, for which We have determined phases [which it must traverse] till it becomes like
                        an
                        old date-stalk, dried-up and curved.” (36:39)
